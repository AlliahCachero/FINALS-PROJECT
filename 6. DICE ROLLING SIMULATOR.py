# FINAL PROJECT

# 6. Dice rolling simulator:
# - Create a game of dice rolling. This game should have 2 players and each player should be
#   able to roll a dice (this should only use random number representing the dice). The game
#   will have a best of three (3) mechanics, meaning the player who won 2 of the three
#   instances is the winner.
