# FINAL PROJECT

# 7. Tic-tac-toe game:
# - Create a game of tic-tac-toe in a console mode without another graphical tool. Each player
#   should enter their names and play the game. Every time the player places an input, the
#   program should produce a screen and show the input of the player. This sequence should
#   continue up to the end of the game.
